*Updated using NASA's EPIC API*  
Imagery ¬© NASA EPIC / DSCOVR  
This repo is powered by a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the entire process.

##What it does

- Runs automatically every day at 9:00 UTC  
- Fetches NASA's Earth images via the EPIC API  
- Updates this README with space imagery and descriptions  
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically  

## Why I built this

This project showcases:

- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows  
- Automation scripts  
- Git operations from within workflows  
- Working with external APIs  

## How it works

The GitHub Action workflow:

1. Runs on a schedule (daily)  
2. Fetches NASA's EPIC Earth Images of the Day  
3. Updates this README  
4. Commits and pushes the changes
